INITIAL PAYMENT DUE AT REGISTRATION

As a new ETF Donor you or your group will be required to commit to donating at least $600 in the first year, which is the minimum amount for each need in our system. Additionally, at least $50 of this total must be received at the time of donor registration. After registration, the donor is able to view and select one of the need profiles. This requirement is intended to provide confidentiality to the people we are serving. 

GENERAL
The use of this site is governed by the policies, terms and conditions as set forth below.  Your use of this site indicates your acceptance of these terms and conditions.  Your donationâ€”in person, through mail, or through this site; directly or indirectly through one of the payment gateway service providers of Especially The Family, indicates your acceptance of these terms and conditions.  These terms and conditions prevail unless otherwise stated differently in any other donation related agreement. 
DONATION STEWARDSHIP

We are committed to the highest standard of stewardship for your contribution and will endeavor to meet designated donation preferences to the best of our abilities; however, your sponsorship is subject to various contingencies, including but not limited to the person in need no longer receiving support for various reasons. Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to communicate individually with each donor regarding such contingencies. In certain circumstances, where despite our best efforts, a donation cannot be carried out in accordance with your stated preferences, funds will be directed toward projects or opportunities of comparable content in a manner that closely honors the original intent of your donation selection. 
After your donation is processed, you will receive an email notification confirming your donation and donation amount within 24 hours and in most case within minutes. This email will serve as your donation receipt. Additionally, you may receive a personalized thank you letter from the beneficiary of your donation.
PAYMENT

In using this site, you certify that the details you provide to us on our site are correct; that 
you are an authorized user of any credit or debit card, or electronic cash that you 
submit for payment; and, that there are sufficient funds or credit facilities to cover any 
donation you make. We reserve the right to obtain validation of your credit or debit card 
details, or verification of the authenticity and ownership of these payment methods before 
taking any other steps in processing your donation. You agree to notify Especially The Family no less than 30 days in writing of your intent to change any banking arrangements 
that affect this authorization at info@especiallythefamily.org.

If your bank account does not contain sufficient funds on the date of the automatic 
transfer, the transaction will be treated in the same manner as a check that was denied due
to insufficient funds, and penalty charges may be applied by your banking institution. 
SECURITY
You are solely responsible in all respects for all use of and for protecting the confidentiality of any username, email verification, and password that may be given to you or selected by you for use on our site. You may not share these with, or transfer them to, any third parties. You must notify us immediately of any un-authorized use of them or any other breach of security regarding our site that comes to your attention at info@especiallythefamily.org.
Your payment transaction will be managed by Authorize.net, Paypal, or another similar industry-leading provider of payment gateway services, which securely and reliably manage the payment transactions of millions of customers globally in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council's Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. 
We have endeavored to make this site as secure as we reasonably can by adopting security and anti-virus practices routinely used as a matter of good practice. However, every internet site, internet communication, and internet-connected computer is susceptible to attack by computer hackers and viruses. While we will take all reasonable measures to protect this site and the internet communications passing through it, we cannot be held responsible for: 
(a) any losses attributable to your failure to take reasonable precautions to prevent interception of, or interference with, any such communications including, without limitations, failure to use and keep up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software on your own computer; or;
(b) any losses arising from fraudulent or un-authorized use of your credit card, debit card, or other forms of payment. If you become aware of fraudulent use or your card, or if it is lost or stolen, you should notify your card issuer immediately.
